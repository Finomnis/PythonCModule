# PythonCModule
A simple python module that acts as an interface for C/C++/Rust code.

It is specifically written and tested for Python 3.x, it does NOT work with Python 2.

## Features
Using this template as a basis for custom C/C++/Rust modules has the following advantages:
* Automatic building, no explicit compilation necessary
* Automatic rebuilding when code has changed
* Compatibility with IDEs like PyCharm
* Automatic compiler detection, due to the usage of python's setuptools
* Very small and easy to understand

## Usage
### C
Before you create your own C modules, you can verify that your system is set up correctly by executing the ``test.py`` script.
If everything is correct, you should see ``Hello, world!`` and no error message.

To create your own C module, just copy and rename the ``helloWorldModule`` folder to wherever you want your module to be.

Then, modify the ``__src`` folder contents:
* Put your methods in header and source file combinations. Try to mimik the style of ``hello.h`` and ``hello.c``.
* Adjust ``module.c`` to include your function headers and add your functions to the ``methods`` array.
* Add python wrappers for your functions to ``wrappers.py``.

### C++
Before you create your own C++ modules, you can verify that your system is set up correctly by executing the ``testCpp.py`` script.
If everything is correct, you should see ``Hello, world!`` and no error message.

The C++ version needs the following Python libraries:
* setuptools
* pybind11

To create your own C++ module, just copy and rename the ``helloWorldCppModule`` folder to wherever you want your module to be.

Then, modify the ``__src`` folder contents:
* Put your methods in header and source file combinations. Try to mimik the style of ``hello.h`` and ``hello.cpp``.
* Adjust ``module.cpp`` to include your function headers and add your functions to the PYBIND11_MODULE definition.
* Add python wrappers for your functions to ``wrappers.py``.

### Rust
Before you create your own Rust modules, you can verify that your system is set up correctly by executing the ``testRust.py`` script.
If everything is correct, you should see ``Hello, world!`` and no error message.

The Rust version needs the following Python libraries:
* setuptools
* setuptools-rust

Also, you need a Rust distribution that is compatible with pyo3.
(At the time of writing, this is Rust nightly. Should change in future.)

To create your own Rust module, just copy and rename the ``helloWorldRustModule`` folder to wherever you want your module to be.

Then, modify the ``__src`` folder contents:
* Modify the folder like a normal cargo project. It is important that the module stays ``__lib``, though.
* Add python wrappers for your functions to ``wrappers.py``.
